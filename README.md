# A-Star-Algorithm-Visualizer
It is a project on A* Algorithm Path Finding Visualization. I have built it using the p5.js library. I would appreciate every contribution in making the project more elegant. Also, it would be a very valuable and important step in correcting any errors or bugs if they exist in it.<br/><br/>

# About A* Algo:
 A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.

 # Key Features!

- Visualization is in real-time
- Users can add walls 
- Users can move the starting and ending location
- Users can clear all walls with a button or can remove a single wall by clicking on it.


## Goal

A* Algorithm or any path finding algorithms are very difficult to visualize. Pictorial demonstration of such algorithms increases the understanding ability. The goal of this repo is to eliminate such difficulty and also to understand the working of such algorithms with ease.
