# A-Star-Algorithm-Visualizer
It is a project on A* Algorithm Path Finding Visualization. I have built it using the p5.js library. I would appreciate every contribution in making the project more elegant. Also, it would be a very valuable and important step in correcting any errors or bugs if they exist in it.

# About A* Algo:
 A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.
