# A-Star-Algorithm-Visualizer
It is a project on A* Algorithm Path Finding Visualization. I have built it using the p5.js library. I would appreciate every contribution in making the project more elegant. Also, it would be a very valuable and important step in correcting any errors or bugs if they exist in it.<br/><br/>

# About A* Algo:
 A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.

 # Key Features!

- Rename all files in a specified directory with any specified naming convension followed by continuous numbering.
- Build with **_RegEx searcher_** that allows a user to search or select some specific files according to the pattern provided.
- Depending on the userâ€™s requirements, they can specify the renaming order based on alphabetical order, time of file creation, or file size.
- Users can also search files based on the file name or file extension or the full filename .
- The tool can also be used in command line interface(CLI) by providing the searching pattern, naming convension and the directory as arguments.

## Goal

    The ultimate goal of this project is to ease the process of renaming bulk files within a fraction of time without any human error. Renaming a large number of files can be sometime a very tedious work to do, which can be simplified with a tool that does it in a fraction of time without any mistakes.

## Usage

Bulk File Rename Tool can be used in two ways. Either in Graphical User Interface(GUI) or in Command Line Interface(CLI).

### Graphical User Interface(GUI) Command

```sh
>> python Bulk_File_Rename_Tool.py
```

### Steps to follow while using the GUI:
**_Step 1:_** Enter _Find Pattern_  <br />
 **_Step 2:_** Enter _Replace with_<br />
**_Step 3:_** Browse Directory & select files<br />
**_Step 4:_** _Rename_<br />

OR

### Command Line Interface(CLI) Command

```sh
>> python Bulk_File_Rename_Tool.py <Directory Path> <Naming Convention> <RegEx Pattern (Optional)>
```

# Important Notes

- The specified RegEx will search in either file name , file extension or both depending on the option choosen in the GUI.
- When _File Name Only_ is chosen, search and rename is done only in file name with continuous numbering.
- When _File Extension Only_ is chosen, search and rename is done only in file extention with no numbering.
- If _Both_ is chosen, the full file name is taken to search buts rename only the file name with proper numbering, keeping the file extension same.
- Users must have to provide with **_Directory Path_** and **_Naming Convention_** to rename.
- If user do not provide any RegEx, the tool will select all files to rename.
- Users must select one or more file to rename. There is a option to select all files at a click.

## Todos

- Automatically add mazes and patterns
- Add different Path Finding Algorithm
